*Product Requirement Document (PRD): Project Jal-SurakshaVersion: 1.0Status: DraftTarget Region: Rural Northeast India (Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, etc.)1. Executive SummaryProject Jal-Suraksha is a localized health-tech solution designed to combat water-borne diseases (Cholera, Typhoid, Dysentery) in the unique geographical and infrastructural context of Northeast India. The system enables frontline health workers to report symptoms in real-time, even without internet, and uses automated logic to identify potential outbreaks before they escalate.2. User PersonasPersonaRolePrimary NeedsASHA/Health WorkerField Data CollectionOffline capability, vernacular support, low-battery consumption.District Health OfficerSurveillance \& ResponseHigh-level heatmaps, resource allocation, rapid alerts.3. Functional Requirements3.1 Field Reporting Module (Mobile App)Offline-First Architecture: Users must be able to log cases without a data connection. Data should auto-sync once a 2G/3G/Wi-Fi signal is detected.Icon-Based UI: To accommodate varying literacy levels, symptoms (e.g., watery diarrhea, high fever) will be represented by clear icons.Automated GPS Tagging: Every report must automatically capture the latitude/longitude and "Village Cluster ID" to map cases accurately.3.2 Early Warning System (EWS) LogicThe system monitors data streams for "hotspots" based on the following threshold:Trigger Condition: If >5 cases of the same symptom category are reported within a single Village Cluster within a rolling 48-hour window.3.3 Notification EnginePrimary Alert: Immediate SMS (standard protocol) to the Local Health Center and District Officer.Secondary Alert: Push notification to all registered health workers in the affected and neighboring clusters.Content: "ALERT: Potential \[Disease] cluster detected in \[Village Name]. 48hr count: \[X]. Action required."3.4 Dashboard (Web Portal)Geospatial Heatmaps: Visualizing case density over time.Trend Analysis: Comparing current week data against historical seasonal averages (e.g., Monsoon spikes).4. Technical Constraints \& SpecificationsHardware: Optimized for Android 8.0+; minimum 2GB RAM.Data Footprint: Light JSON payloads to ensure syncing works on 2G "Edge" networks.Security: AES-256 encryption for Patient Identifiable Information (PII) during sync.5. Success Metrics (KPIs)Lead Time to Alert: Reduce the time from first symptom to district notification from days to <2 hours.Sync Reliability: 99% of offline data successfully uploaded within 12 hours of connection.Outbreak Containment: Percentage of triggered alerts that resulted in medical intervention before reaching 20 cases.*
